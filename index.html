      <h1 style="color: #fcfc;"> Semaphores</h1>
       <p>Stimulating a scenario where multiple producers and consumers
        interact within a shared buffer, using sychcronization mechanisms to avoid data races and simulate variable 
        and asynchronous behaviour.<br>
        Semaphores, or primitive sychcronization in general play a crucial role in the realm of Security. 
        Semaphores are used to control access to shared resources or critical sections of code. Semaphores can also help manage concurrent access to resources to prevent data corruption, leaks or unauth modifications.<a href="https://github.com/daku-bebop/SemaphoresP_adil">Check it out..</a>

      <h1> Embracing Linux: Why Arch is a my Daily Driver</h1>
      <p>I embarked on the journey of hopping through Linux distributions trying to find one that stuck. I tried Fedora, Mint, Manjaro and even Ubuntu. 
        My initial reason to stray away from the usual windows or osx devices was the riddled bloat infested upon download.
        I found my perfect match once I stumbled across Arch.
        <ul>User-Centric:</ul> <p>It doesnt come pre-installed with a flashy desktop environment. Instead it offers a bare-bones system that allows you to build from the ground up. </p>
        <ul>Pacman:</ul><p>The package manager for Arch, incredibly fast and efficient. It resolves dependencies, installs, and updates sw with a single command.</p>
        <ul>Customization: </ul><p> Just like any other distro, you can change your desktop environment. I chose i3 with gaps. To allow for a lightweight tiling wm.
          The flexibility that lets you craft an environment that suits your workflow and preferences.
